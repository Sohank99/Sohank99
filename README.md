Hi, I’m Sohan, an aspiring Data Analyst passionate about turning complex data into clear, actionable insights. I specialize in using tools like Power BI, SQL, Python, and Excel to explore, analyze, and visualize data that supports smart business decisions.

I enjoy solving real-world problems through data storytelling, building dashboards, and simplifying data for stakeholders. I’m also continuously learning about data wrangling, data modeling, and analytics best practices to sharpen my skills.

Currently, I’m open to internship or full-time opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow in a collaborative environment. Let’s connect and talk data!
